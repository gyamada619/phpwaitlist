# phpwaitlist
A project built to facilitate management of an equipment checkout wait list for the [Abilene Christian University Learning Studio](http://blogs.acu.edu/learningstudio).

System Requirements: 

1. Apache
2. PHP 5.4 or above
3. MySQL

When you have installed the LAMP stack, clone the repository into /var/www/html and use <code>waitlist.sql</code> to import the table structure. 

This waitlist can be used for any business and the branding easily changed with a few lines of CSS. Store your logo in <code>img/logo.png</code>, change the background color in the body tag, and voila!
